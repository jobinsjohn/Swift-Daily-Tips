// Repeat-While
// The other variation of the while loop, known as the repeat-while loop,
// performs a single pass through the loop block first, before considering
// the loopâ€™s condition. It then continues to repeat the loop until the
// condition is false.

// The repeat-while loop in Swift is analogous to a do-while loop in
// other languages.

    // move by the rolled amount
