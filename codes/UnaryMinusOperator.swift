// Unary Minus Operator

// The sign of a numeric value can be toggled using a prefixed -,
// known as the unary minus operator:

let three = 3
let minusThree = -three       // minusThree equals -3
let plusThree = -minusThree   // plusThree equals 3, or "minus minus three"

// The unary minus operator (-) is prepended directly before the value
// it operates on, without any white space.
